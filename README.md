# PROJECT-1
# Drowsiness detector for Drivers
This is my first Machine learning project which
We as a team made in our early 2nd year as
a  part of Project Exhibition 1.
The Target audience are people who can drive
4 or more wheeled vehicles(cars,trucks)
# Motive
This project deals with the situation when the driver
is sleepy or not active while driving which is
a possibility and happened many times which resulted
in many drastic accidents.our work is mainly 
focused to prevent such horrible events.
